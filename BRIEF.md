# Hackathon #2: Bridget Jones Diary 📒

> **But… what is a Hackathon?**

- Hacking is **creative problem solving**
- A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to **solve problems**
- Don’t expect to have actually solved a problem by the end of the hackathon. **Real life problems are hard!** Think of the hackathon as a pit-stop on a long journey to solve problems or as a training session to practice your **problem solving skills**

### Duration

This is a whole day hackathon!

### Team setup

Pairs of students / teams of 3 if odd numbers

### What?

Do you love the sound of your own voice? Do you feel that you have something to share that you don't want anyone else to see?

This is your chance to write about your wildest dreams, deepest fears and regrettable choices. We want you to build your own version of the Bridget Jones's Diary!

The goal of this hackathon is to build a **Personal Diary app** using all the concepts you have learned so far:

- **Backend development** (Javascript, Express/API)
- **Front-end development** (HTML and CSS)
- **Databases** (SQL)
- **MVC structure**
- **UX methodologies**

Your app’s purpose is to **manage and keep track of diary entries**. A user should be able to **see**, **create**, **update** and **delete** diary entries.

Your application will need to have a backend, a frontend and a database:

- For the backend, use **Express** and **JavaScript**
- For the frontend, use **HTML** and **CSS**
- You can manage your database with **SQL**
- You can use **Docker** for your database, or an external host if you would prefer (e.g **Supabase**)

### User stories

As a **user**, I should be able to:

- **Create** a diary entry with a specific date and time, text and category
- **See** a list of my diary entries and sort them by recency
- **See** the details of a specific diary entry
- **Search for** a specific diary entry by date/month/year or category
- **Update** the text of a diary entry
- **Delete** a diary entry

### Extensions

You **do not need** to do all of those. Choose one or two to implement if time allows:

- The ability to add images to each data entry and attach them to diary entries
- Allow users to find a particular diary entry by searching for a string
- Add an additional feature to the app such as a motivational quote generator or weather generator for the day using an external API
- Add authentification to the app
- Make it pretty!

### How?

- Google is your friend! If you get stuck on anything, your first resort should be google, then you can ask your peers, and finally come to us if none of the previous solutions helped you
- Make sure to host your project on **Github** and send your repository link to your cohort group **by 3pm**
- Your repo should have an informative and structured **README** that includes how to run the application and any other setup instructions. See our [Writing READMEs guide](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Writing-READMEs) for details.
- In pairs, make sure to practice **pair programming**. Alternate between being a driver and navigator
    - *Driver* - writes code
    - *Navigator* - reviews each line of code as it is typed in
- **You can also use LiveShare on VS Code to collaborate**

### Guidance

- Take time to brainstorm with your pair and choose the kind of personal diary you’d like to build 🧠
- Talk about how you’d want the coding process to go 🗣️
- Create a Github repository for your project and make your partner a collaborator of the project 📁
- Start by designing the data model for your project 🗓️
- Focus on function over form 🕺
- Follow the MVC structure 🗂️
- Make sure to take breaks, hydrate and stretch 💧

### Deliverables

- A **Github** link to your code **by 3pm** on your cohort group
- **OPTIONAL**: A link to the deployed app

**HAVE SOME FUN!** 🕺 💃
